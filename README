A very basic attempt at some of the features of the Firefox plugin of the same name http://timothyhumphrey.name/firefox/lasttab.aspx
Ctrl+s is the keyboard shortcut I've picked for now to switch to you most recently opened tab.
After you close a tab the most recently used tab should then be selected.
