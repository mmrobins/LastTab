[ ] icon so I can upload to google
[ ] if you hold ctrl and continue to click it should keep going through the list
[ ] options page to change the keyboard shortcut
[ ] load/update tabs already active so that if you install or reinstall it you don't have to restart
[ ] switch to most recent tab if the current tab icon is clicked - not sure there's a listener for that
[ ] have it work on new pages where nothing is loaded yet.  problem is empty page doesn't load content scripts
[ ] maybe have it work on the extensions page too, but based on docs it doesn't look possible now
[ ] popup that shows a sorted list of tabs like the firefox version would be cool
[ ] there has to be an easier way to remove an array element in javascript than an ugly for loop
